## About this

Simple terrain generation test based on simplex noise.  
Code is pretty horrible for now, and the whole thing is a work in progress.  
The Simplex noise is using [simplex-noise.js by Jonas Wagner](https://github.com/jwagner/simplex-noise.js).  

For now, it does the following:  
- Generates a two dimension array map with heights from 0 to 1  
- Builds the map either in 3D with Three.js

TODO:  
- Add moisture, to create more interesting biomes  
- Add temperature, to add even more diversity  
- Isometric visualization?  
- ...
